# ScriptRunner

ScriptRunner is an experimental library that allows easy integration of Python widgets into your web app.

## Overview

Welcome to ScriptRunner! This tool enables you to create and manage Python functions through a web interface. Here are a couple of screenshots demonstrating its features:

### Testing Widgets
If you receive a "yay" response, everything is working fine. Otherwise, you'll get an HTML error message. If you encounter issues, try the following steps:
1. Restart your server.
2. Close and reopen the files (scriptRunner.html, scriptRunner.js, views.py, functions.py).
3. Clear your browser cache if necessary.

Typically, these steps resolve any issues, and you won't need to repeat them.
